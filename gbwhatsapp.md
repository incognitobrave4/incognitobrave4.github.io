## GB Whatsapp and 6 other Whatsapp Apps
The illegal Whatsapp application or known as MOD (modification) is arguably in great demand by smartphone users.

Whatsapp MOD offers additional and modified features compared to the official Whatsapp.

However, the application is dangerous for users because it was developed by an unauthorized third party.

Modified illegal Whatsapp poses a risk to user security and is vulnerable to data theft. This is because the application is more susceptible to malware and spyware insertion because the servers hosted are less secure.

Illegal Whatsapp applications are also generally not equipped with encryption features so that messages can potentially be read by third parties.

Reported by Tricks Galaxy, the following is a list of illegal Whatsapp that needs to be known and a series of dangers that lurk its users.

### 1. GB WHATSAPP

GB Whatsapp is an illegal application whose features have been modified so that it is not like the official Whatsapp.

WA GB access is of course not available on the Play Store or App Store because according to publishing policies it can only be installed from third-party sources on the device.

### 2. YO Whatsapp

Another illegal Whatsapp application is yo Whatsapp (YOWA) which was developed by application developer Yousef Al - Basha.

The excellent feature that YOWA offers is being able to lock applications. Even so, YOWhatsapp is still illegal because it violates the policies of Whatsapp Inc.

### 3. Whatsapp MA

After the original Whatsapp, it was quite limited in terms of themes and only provided a light or dark mode version.

While Whatsapp MA modifies it so that users can apply the theme as they like. Even this illegal application has entered the Play Store.

### 4. Whatsapp Indigo

The size of the file capacity provided by the official Whatsapp is a maximum of 16 MB. However, Whatsapp Indigo actually offers 73 MB.

With 73 MB, users can send photo or video content with more HD resolution. Apart from that Whatsapp Indigo is still illegal.

### 5. OG Whatsapp

OG Whatsapp is still similar to other illegal Whatsapp which has been modified and has unlimited character features to write statuses.

If on the original Whatsapp the user has to cut the appearance of the photo on the profile, on OG Whatsapp you can completely install the photo.

### 6. Whatsapp FM

FM Whatsapp is said to facilitate users so that they can use several numbers at once.

Apart from that, FM Whatsapp provides other options like unlimited chat rooms and more than 30 types of tick marks with bubble style.

### 7. Whatsapp Gold Edition

In terms of features, Whatsapp Gold or Whatsapp Plus is almost the same as the original, so you are worried about making users fooled.

But keep in mind that Whatsapp Gold or Plus is an illegal application because the system steals from the original Whatsapp.
